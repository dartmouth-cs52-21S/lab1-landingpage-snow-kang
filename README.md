# Cones of Snow Website

My landing page based off of https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/

[deployed url](https://dartmouth-cs52-21s.github.io/lab1-landingpage-snow-kang/)

## What Worked Well
- I was able to mimic most of the website from league. I chose the sections I thought would be the most challenging and had a lot of fun trying to recreate them. 

## What Didn't
- I spent so much time adding features I thought were "cool" that I didn't have a lot of time to work on the content itself so I have a lot of filler text/images and not a lot of cohesion in the ideas per section. in the future i'll work on managing my time better, getting all the functionality working before I dive into design.
- I was not able to recreate the the opening visual on the league website. I inspected the page and they have two identical videos playing synchronously, one blurred in the background and one on top to give the effect of the blurred edges. 

## Extra Credit
- Created a rendition of the carousel from https://codeburst.io/how-to-pure-css-carousel-ce1a8cb231c8 to imitate the one on league's webpage. Added the functionality that you click on any image in the carousel slider (one apart and two apart) to transition to it with a sliding, resizing, and recoloring effect
- Created tabbed areas using https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/
- Created dynamic hamburger menu with https://medium.com/@heyoka/responsive-pure-css-off-canvas-hamburger-menu-aebc8d11d793
- Menu items have anchors to the corresponding section
- In mobile view, the "Featured Updates" section has horizontal sliding
- The "Links section" has vertical selection tabs for desktop and horizontal for mobile
- Menu items, footer items, and main button have hover effects (color change)
- Functional on all device sizes
