# Cones of Snow Website

My landing page based off of https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/

[deployed url](https://dartmouth-cs52-21s.github.io/lab1-landingpage-snow-kang/)

## What Worked Well
- I was able to mimic most of the website from league. I chose the sections I thought would be the most challenging and had a lot of fun trying to recreate them. 

## What Didn't
- I spent so much time adding features I didn't have a lot of time to work on content itself so I have a lot of filler text/images. in the future i'll work on managing my time better, getting all the functionality working before I dive into design
- I was not able to recreate the synchronized stacked videos (the opening visual on league) 

## Extra Credit
- Created a rendition of the carousel from https://codeburst.io/how-to-pure-css-carousel-ce1a8cb231c8 to imitate the one on league's webpage
- Created tabbed areas using https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/
- Created dynamic hamburger menu with https://medium.com/@heyoka/responsive-pure-css-off-canvas-hamburger-menu-aebc8d11d793
- Menu items have anchors to the corresponding section
- In mobile view, the "Featured Updates" section has horizontal sliding
- The "Links section" has vertical selection tabs for desktop and horizontal for mobile
- Menu items and main button have hover effects
